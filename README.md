# C Basics and Data Structures

This repository contains exercises and small programs written in C during my first semesters at university.  
They cover topics from **Programming Logic** and **Data Structures**, such as arrays, pointers, functions, recursion, and linked lists.

##  Contents

- Basic syntax and input/output
- Control structures (if, while, for)
- Arrays and matrices
- Functions and recursion
- Pointers
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Linked lists, stacks, and queues

##  Purpose

This repository documents my early journey learning how to program and think computationally.  
It’s meant for personal study and growth tracking, not as production code.

---

##  Notes

Each file or folder represents a different exercise or topic.  
Comments inside the code explain my thought process and solutions.
